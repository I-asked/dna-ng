h1. DotNetAnywhere NG

DotNetAnywhere (DNA) is a interpreted .NET CIL runtime.

The runtime itself is written in C and has been designed to be as small and portable as possible, allowing .NET software to be used on resource-constrained devices where it is not possible to run a full .NET runtime.

h2. Limitations

DNA only supports 32-bit targets. This is a difficult to fix bug which DNA-NG will attempt to fix in the future.

h2. Building

bc. $ cmake -S dna -B _builddir/Debug \
        -G 'Unix Makefiles' \
        -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
        -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="${PWD}/install"
$ cmake --build _builddir/Debug -j
$ cmake --install _builddir/Debug
